# Insecta - a project for the 2025 [FMI{Codes}](https://fmicodes.com/bg) Hackathon
By Kolegite

The project is a web app that is desined mainly for mobile. It lets users take photos of bugs they encounter in nature and add them to their digital colletion.
The photographed bugs are transformed into a collectable card that can be traded with other players. Each card comes with interesting facts about the bug that it represents.
The goal is to encourage young people to engage with nature and learn more about the interesting world of insects.

There is also a PvE experience where people choose 5 of the strongest bugs from their collection and go up against a virtual enemy.
